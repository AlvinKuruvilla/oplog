# Dailymotion Operation Log

The Dailymotion OpLog is a Go agent meant to run on every PHP server, listening for UDP commands from the website describing every changes happening on a Dailymotion object.

The agent exposes an [Server Sent Event](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) API for external consumers to be notified in real time about model changes.

For more information, see the [Wiki page](https://wiki.dailymotion.com/display/XP/OpLog) about this project.

## Install

    go build -o /usr/local/bin/oplogd github.com/dailymotion/oplog/cmd/oplogd

## UDP API

To send operation events to the agent, an UDP datagram a JSON object must be crafted and sent on the agent's UDP port (8042 by default).

The format of the message is as follow:

```javascript
{
    "event": "INSERT",
    "user_id": "x1234",
    "type": "video",
    "id": "x345",
}
```

All keys are required:

* `event`: The type of event. Can be `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.
* `user_id`: The owner xid of the modified object.
* `type`: The object type (i.e.: `video`, `user`, `playlist`…)
* `id`: The object xid of the impacted object.

Only xid must be used, numerical ids aren't accepted.

## SSE API

The SSE API runs on the same port as UDP API but using TCP. The W3C SSE protocol is respected by the book. To connect to the API, a GET on `/ops` with the `Accept: text/event-stream` header must be performed.

On each received event, the client must store the last event id and submit it back to the server on reconnect using the `Last-Event-ID` HTTP header. The client must then ensure the `Last-Event-ID` header is sent back in the response. It may happen that the id defined by `Last-Event-ID` is no longer available, in this case, the agent won't send the backlog and will ignore the `Last-Event-ID` header.

```
GET /ops HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/event-stream

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/event-stream; charset=utf-8

id: 545b55c7f095528dd0f3863c
event: INSERT
data: {"timestamp":"2014-11-06T03:04:39.041-08:00","user_id":"x1234","type":"video","id":"x345"}

id: 545b55c8f095528dd0f3863d
event: DELETE
data: {"timestamp":"2014-11-06T03:04:40.091-08:00","user_id":"x1234","type":"video","id":"x345"}

…
```

## Status Endpoint

The agent exposes a `/status` endpoint over HTTP to show some statistics about the agent. A JSON object is returned with the following fields:

* `events_received`: Total number of events recieved on the UDP interface
* `events_ingested`: Total number of events ingested into MongoDB with success
* `events_error`: Total number of events received on the UDP interface with an invalid format
* `events_discarded`: Total number of events discarded because the queue was full
* `queue_size`: Current number of events in the ingestion queue
* `queue_max_size`:  Maximum number of events allowed in the ingestion queue before discarding events
* `clients`: Number of clients connected to the SSE API

```javascript
GET /status

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 144
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 06 Nov 2014 10:40:25 GMT

{
    "clients": 0,
    "events_discarded": 0,
    "events_error": 0,
    "events_ingested": 0,
    "events_received": 0,
    "queue_max_size": 100000,
    "queue_size": 0,
    "status": "OK"
}
```
